# SkinDetection


This project is to experiment with color manipulation, understand the coding and impact of light conditions on color characteristics.
For that we have to realize a program that allows detecting the color of the human skin by the thresholding of the values of colors. 


To run the program you have to execute : skindetction.py 

Turn the camera on to see the result.
